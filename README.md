Moduel 13, challenge 13

 # Description

 Given a functional express API, i am tasked with building a App that has a .env variable capable of connecting to the SQL database using the sequelize package.  The app is then seeded with test/seed data.  When i invoke the application then the server is started and mysql and sequelize models are synced.  Using the GET, POST, PUT, DELETE routes i created, i am then able to test my app using the insomnia application.
